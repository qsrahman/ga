var g = ga(256, 256, setup);

//Declare global sprites, objects, and variables
//that you want to access in all the game functions and states

var ball, bricks;

//A `setup` function that will run only once.
//Use it for initialization tasks
function setup() {

  //Make the background white and add a border to the canvas
  g.backgroundColor = "white";
  g.canvas.style.border = "1px black dashed";

  //Figure out a random diameter for the falling ball
  var randomDiameter = g.randomInt(8, 32);
 
  //Create the ball using the random diameter
  ball = g.circle(randomDiameter, "red");

  //Position the ball randomly somewhere across the top of the canvas

  /*
  Create the grid of pegs using the `grid` function. `grid` returns a
  `group` sprite object that contains a sprite for every cell in the
  grid. You can define the rows and columns in the grid, whether or
  not the sprites should be centered inside each cell, or what their offset from the
  top left corner of each cell should be. Supply a function that
  returns the sprite that you want to make for each cell. You can
  supply an optional final function that runs any extra code after
  each sprite has been created. Here's the format for creating a grid:

      gridGroup = grid(

        //Set the grid's properties
        rows, columns, cellWidth, cellHeight, 
        areSpirtesCentered?, xOffset, yOffset,

        //A function that returns a sprite
        function() {return g.circle(16, "blue");},

        //A optional final function that runs some extra code
        function() {console.log("extra!");}
      );
  */

  bricks = g.grid(

    //Set the grid's properties
    5, 4, 48, 48, 
    true, 0, 0,

    //A function that describes how to make each brick in the grid
    function() {
      var brick = g.rectangle(g.randomInt(8, 32), g.randomInt(8, 32));
      brick.fillStyle = colors[g.randomInt(0, 4)];
      return brick;
    },

    //Run any extra code after each peg is made, if you want to
    function() {console.log("extra!");}
  );

  //Position the grid of pegs
  bricks.setPosition(8, 48);

  //Change the state to `play`
  g.state = play;  
}

//The `play` function will run in a loop
function play() {

  //Apply gravity to the ball's vertical velocity
  ball.vy += ball.gravity;
  
  //Apply friction. ball.frictionX will be 0.96 if the ball is
  //on the ground, and 1 if it's in the air
  ball.vx *= ball.frictionX;

  //Move the ball by applying the new calculated velocity
  //to the ball's x and y position
  g.move(ball);

  //Check for a collision with the ball and the stage's boundary, and
  //make the ball bounce by setting setting the last argument 
  //in the `contain` method to `true`
  var stageCollision = g.contain(ball, g.stage.localBounds, true);

  //If the ball hit the bottom of the stage, add some so
  //that the ball gradually rolls to a stop
  if(stageCollision === "bottom") {
    ball.frictionX = 0.96;
  } else {
    ball.frictionX = 1;
  }

  //Check for a collision between the ball and the pegs using the
  //universal `hit` method.
  //arguments: circle, arrayOfCircles, reactToCollision?,
  //bounceApart?, useGlobalPositions?
  g.hit(ball, bricks.children, true, true, true);

  //Alternatively, use a `forEach` loop and the lower-level
  //`circleRectangleCollision` method
  /*
  bricks.children.forEach(function(brick) {
    
    //Make the ball bounce if it hits any of the pegs. Use the 
    //`circleCollision` function to check for collisions between
    //a moving circle and a stationary circle. Set the third argument to
    //`false` to prevent the circles from bouncing, and set the fourth
    //argument to `false` if you want to use the circle's local x/y
    //coordinates. (The global coordinates will be used by default)
    //`circleRectangleCollision` arguments:
    //movingCircle, stationaryCircle, bounce?, globalCoordinates?
    
    g.circleRectangleCollision(ball, brick, true, true);
