Use the `emitter` function to create a constant stream of particles
at fixed intervals. The emitter is a simple timer that calls the 
`particleEffect` function repeatedly at intervals in milliseconds that
you define. Use the emitter's `play` and `stop` methods to start and 
stop the particle stream.
