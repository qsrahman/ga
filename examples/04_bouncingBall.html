/*
Learn how to make a ball bounce around the canvas
with gravitym, friction and mass.

This file requires these convenience functions from `plugins.js`:
`randomInt`
`contain``
*/

//Create a new GA instance, and start it.
//Pre-load a texture atlas called `animals.json` from the `images`
//folder.
var g = ga(256, 256, setup);
g.start();

//Declare global sprites, objects, and variables
//that you want to access in all the game functions and states.
//In this example there's just one: `ball`.

var ball;

//A `setup` function that will run only once.
//Use it for initialization tasks.
function setup() {

  //Make a ball sprite.
  //circle arguments: diameter, fillStyle, strokeStyle, lineWidth, x, y
  ball = g.circle(32, "white", "none", 2, 96, 128); 

  //Set the ball's velocity to 0
  ball.vx = g.randomInt(5, 15);
  ball.vy = g.randomInt(5, 15);

  //Physics properties
  ball.gravity = 0.3;
  ball.frictionX = 1; 
  ball.frictionY = 0;
  ball.mass = 1.3;

  //Acceleration and friction properties
  ball.accelerationX = 0.2;
  ball.accelerationY = -0.2;
  ball.frictionX = 1;
  ball.frictionY = 1;

  //Change the game state to `play`.
  g.state = play;  
}

//The `play` function will run in a loop
function play() {

  //Apply gravity to the vertical velocity
  ball.vy += ball.gravity;
  
  //Apply friction. ball.frictionX will be 0.96 if the ball is
  //on the ground, and 1 if it's in the air
  ball.vx *= ball.frictionX;
  
  //Move the ball by applying the new calculated velocity
  //to the ball's x and y position
  ball.x += ball.vx;
  ball.y += ball.vy;
  
  //Use Ga's custom `contain` method to bounce the ball 
  //off the canvas edges and slow it to a stop:

  //1. Use the `contain` method to create a `collision` object 
  //that checks for a collision between the ball and the
  //rectangular area of the stage. Setting `contain`'s 3rd
  //argument to `true` will make the ball bounce off the 
  //stage's edges.
  var collision = g.contain(ball, g.stage.localBounds, true);

  //2. If the collision object has a value of "bottom", it means
  //the ball has hit the bottom of the stage. In that case, use
  //friction to slow it down.
  if (collision === "bottom") {

    //Slow the ball down if it hits the bottom of the stage.
    ball.frictionX = 0.96;
  } else {

    //If the ball isn't touching the bottom of the stage, it must
    //still be in the air. In that case,
    //give the ball a `frictionX` value of `1`, which essentially
    //means "don't apply friction" so that it moves freely.
    ball.frictionX = 1;
  }

  //You can optionally write the bounce code manually using the following 4 if
  //statements.
  //These if statements all work in the same way:
  //If the ball crosses the canvas boundaries:
  //1. It's repositioned inside the canvas.
  //2. Its velocity is reversed to make it bounce, with
  //the mass subtracted so that it looses force over time.
  //3. If it's on the ground, friction is added to slow it down
